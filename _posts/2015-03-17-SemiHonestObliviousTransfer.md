This page describes a few basic protocols for oblivious transfer ($\textsf{OT}$) schemes and some theoretical results related to them. The [next post]({% post_url 2015-04-11-ObliviousTransferExtensions %}) will consider $\textsf{OT}$ extensions &mdash; which are needed when performing a large number of oblivious transfers.

## Semi-Honest Base OT: Syntax and Semantics
---

Semi-honest Alice ($\mathbb{A}$) has two single-bit messages $m_0$ and $m_1$. Semi-honest Bob ($\mathbb{B}$) has a single choice bit $b$. Alice wants to send one &mdash; and only one &mdash; of her two messages to Bob. Bob, depending upon his choice bit $b$, wants to access $m_b$ but does not want Alice to know which message he picked. This interaction is summarized in the following diagram:

Furthermore, the sender should remain oblivious to the messages that the receiver selected.

This, and other potential deviations from the prescribed protocol, need to be handled using a _maliciously secure_ oblivious transfer scheme which is **not covered in this document**. This document only considers semi-honest adversary, which never deviates from the prescribed protocol. (Of course, a semi-honest adversary is not much of an adversary, but it's a useful building block for almost all maliciously secure OT schemes.)

The correctness requirements for an OT protocol are obvious: If Bob's choice bit is $b$, then $\forall m_0, m_1 \in \{0,1\}$, with high probability, Bob should receive $m_b$. The privacy requirements are stated after introducing some notation.

Let $\pi_i$ be the protocol executed by party $\mathcal{P}_i$ to jointly evaluate $f(x_1, \cdots, x_n)$. Abusing notation, we will use $\pi$ to mean the overall protocol (an interactive Turing machine) that produces all the necessary outputs that are exchanged between parties.

Note that at any point in time, Alice's view contains all the information to _deterministically generate_ all the messages sent from Alice to Bob.

Since the set of values for $r_\mathbb{A}$ and $r_\mathbb{B}$ are finite, the size of the set $\mathbb{T}(a,b)$ is finite.

The privacy requirements for Alice and Bob can be summarized as:

#### Privacy Requirements


1. **Alice's Privacy**: Let Bob's choice bit be $b$ and let $\mathcal{D}$ be a polynomial time algorithm (called a distinguisher) that a corrupt Bob is trying to use to glean extra information about $m_{1-b}$ from its message transcript

   $$\tau := \langle \mathbb{A}, \mathbb{B}\rangle(m_0, m_1, b)$$

   An OT scheme preserves Alice's privacy if, given $\tau$, the probability with which $\mathcal{D}$ can distinguish $m_{1-b}$ from $1$ (or, for that matter, $0$) with probability significantly greater than $\frac{1}{2}$ is negligible, i.e.,

   $$\forall \mathcal{D} \in \text{p.p.t} \wedge \forall \tau:\;\mathbf{Pr}\left[\mathcal{D}(b, m_b, \tau) = 1\right] < \frac{1}{2} + \textsf{negl}$$

   where the probability is taken over the private random choices of Alice and Bob as well as the internal randomness of $\mathcal{D}$.
2. **Bob's Privacy**: Let $\mathcal{D}'$ be a polynomial time distinguisher that corrupt Alice is trying to use to find information about $b$ from her message transcript

   $$\tau := \langle \mathbb{A}, \mathbb{B}\rangle(m_1, m_2, b)$$

   An OT scheme preserves Bob's privacy if, given $\tau$, the probability that $\mathcal{D}'$ can guess the value of $b$ with probability significantly greater than $\frac{1}{2}$ is negligible, i.e.,

   $$\forall \mathcal{D}' \in \text{p.p.t}\wedge \forall \tau:\;\mathbf{Pr}\left[\mathcal{D}'(m_1, m_0, \tau) = b\right] < \frac{1}{2} + \textsf{negl}$$

   where the probability is taken over the private random choices of Alice and Bob as well as the internal randomness of $\mathcal{D'}$.

## OT Theoretical Results
---

This section lists some well known theoretical results related to Oblivious Transfer.

> ##### Theorem
> Information theoretically secure oblivious transfer schemes don't exist.
>

We will prove this theorem in two stages: First we will show that given _any
oblivious transfer scheme_

$$\textsf{OT}(m_0, m_1;\; b) \to m_b$$

one can use it as a black box to construct a _two party MPC protocol_ $
\textsf{2pc}_{\wedge} $ that computes the boolean `and` ($\wedge$)
of two bits $a$ and $b$, i.e.,

$$\exists \; \textsf{OT}(m_0, m_1;\; b) \implies \exists \; \textsf{2pc}_{\wedge}(a;\;b) := a\wedge b $$

Second, we will prove that there does not exist _any_ information theoretically secure $$\textsf{2pc}_{\wedge}(a;\;b)$$ and conclude the contrapositive that there _does not
exist_ any information-theoretically $\textsf{OT}$ scheme.

> **Proof** [ $ \textsf{OT} \implies 2\textsf{pc}_\wedge $ ]:
>
> Suppose $\textsf{Alice}$ has bit $a$ and $\textsf{Bob}$ has bit $b$ and $\textsf{Alice}$ and $\textsf{Bob}$ want to jointly compute $\textsf{2pc}_{\wedge}(a;\;b)$ using $\textsf{OT}(m_0, m_1;\; b)$ as a black box.

>
>
> **<u>Claim</u>**: The output of above oblivious transfer setup securely computes $a \wedge b$. Reason:
> 1. Correctness holds because $\textsf{OT}(0, a;\; b) = \left [0\wedge (\neg b) \right ] \oplus \left [a\wedge b \right ] = a\wedge b$.
>
> 2. $\textsf{Alice}$'s privacy holds because of $\textsf{OT}$ sender's privacy guarantee: Namely, if $b = 0$ then the receiver always gets $0$ as its output &mdash; regardless of the value of $a$! Note that when $b = 1$, then any 2-party MPC `and` protocol will reveal the value of $a$, but that's not a privacy breach because even an ideal world implementation of `and` function will leak this information. Furthermore, if $\textsf{OT}$ is maliciously secure or semi-honestly secure, then so is $2\textsf{pc}_\wedge$.
>
> 3. $\textsf{Bob}$'s privacy holds because of $\textsf{OT}$ receiver's privacy guarantees. In particular, $\textsf{OT}$ guarantees that the sender will never learn the value of $b$ with non-negligible probability.


We now prove that its impossible to have an information theoretically secure two party $\wedge$ gate computation.

> ##### Lemma
> There is no information theoretically secure $2\textsf{pc}_\wedge$ MPC scheme with (a) perfect correctness and (b) perfect privacy.
>

Suppose there exists such an information theoretically secure $2\textsf{pc}_\wedge(a;\;b)$ MPC protocol and suppose one of the parties $\textsf{Alice}$ (whose input is $a$) is malicious. We will show that if $\textsf{Alice}$ is computationally unbounded, then just based on the protocol transcript $\tau(a,b)$, she can breach $\textsf{Bob}$'s privacy (whose input is $b$). Note that breaching $\textsf{Bob}$'s privacy is only meaningful when $\textsf{Alice}$'s own input $a$ is $0$. This is because when $a = 1$, the value of $b$ is readily available to $\textsf{Alice}$ (as the final result of the computation) and there's no expectation of privacy in that case. In short, $\textsf{Alice}$'s concrete goal is to find the value of $b$ given that her own input $a = 0$.

>
> **<u>Proof</u>:**
>
> The high level idea of the proof is to build a distinguisher for $b$ by exploiting the properties of the transcript set $$\mathbb{T}(a,b) := \left \{ \tau(a,b) \right \}_{r_\textsf{Alice}, r_\textsf{Bob}}$$ for different values of $a$ and $b$. In particular, it's based on the observation that the transcript set of _any_ $$2\textsf{pc}_\wedge(a;\;b)$$ MPC protocol with _perfect correctness_ and _perfect privacy_ must be identical when either $a=0$ or $b=0$, i.e.,
>
> $$\mathbb{T}(0,0) = \mathbb{T}(1,0) = \mathbb{T}(0,1)$$
>
> but very distinct when $a=1$ and $b=1$, namely,
> $$\mathbb{T}(0,1) \cap \mathbb{T}(1,1) = \phi$$
>
> A computationally unbounded $\textsf{Alice}$ will use these facts (which are proved later in this section), to build a distinguisher to decide if the protocol transcript $\tau(0,b)$ is an element of  $\mathbb{T}(0,0)$ or $\mathbb{T}(0,1)$ and breach $\textsf{Bob}$'s privacy.
>
> Here's the concrete strategy $\textsf{Alice}$ can use:
>
> * Since $\textsf{Alice}$ is computationally unbounded, she can enumerate all possible random values (i.e., $r_\textsf{Alice}$ and $r_\textsf{Bob}$) used by the protocol to build a table corresponding to the transcript set
>
>   $$\mathbb{T}(1,0) = \{ \tau(1, 0) \}_{r_\textsf{Alice}, r_\textsf{Bob}}$$
>
>   in her spare time.
> * After this table is built, $\textsf{Alice}$ runs her protocol $2\textsf{pc}_\wedge(a;\;b)$ with input $a = 0$ to obtain the transcript $\tau(0,b)$. Notice that the table $\textsf{Alice}$ has built is for $a = 1$ and $b = 0$, but the actual protocol runs over the values $a=0$ and $b$ unknown.
> * Given the transcript $\tau(0,b)$, $\textsf{Alice}$ searches through the table $\mathbb{T}(1,0)$ to find if $\tau(0,b)$ is present or not, and concludes as follows:
>
>   $$\tau(0,b) \in \mathbb{T}(1,0) \implies \begin{cases}b = 0\; \text{if true}\\ b = 1\; \text{otherwise}\end{cases}$$
>
>
> The reason this strategy succeeds is because as sets $\mathbb{T}(0,0)$ and $\mathbb{T}(1,0)$ are identical. Concretely that means, if $\tau(0,0)$ corresponds to random coin tosses $(r_{\textsf{Alice}}, r_{\textsf{Bob}})$ during protocol execution, then there must exist some other random choices $$(r'_{\textsf{Alice}}, r'_{\textsf{Bob}})$$ for which $\tau(1,0)$ = $\tau(0,0)$. Furthermore, since $\mathbb{T}(1,0) \cap \mathbb{T}(1,1) = \phi$, presence of $\tau(0,b)$ in $\mathbb{T}(1,0)$, implies absence from $\mathbb{T}(1,1)$. Therefore, testing for set membership of $\tau(0,b)$ in $\mathbb{T}(1,0)$ is sufficient to conclude if $b = 0$ or $b = 1$.
>
> The only thing left to prove is that $\mathbb{T}(0,0) = \mathbb{T}(1,0)$ and $\mathbb{T}(1,0) \cap \mathbb{T}(1,1) = \phi$. We prove these as two separate claims:
>
> **<u>Claim</u>**: $\mathbb{T}(0,0) = \mathbb{T}(1,0)$
>
> **<u>Proof</u>**: First note that the output of $2\textsf{pc}_\wedge(a;\;b)$ is the same when either $a=0$ or $b = 0$. We will show that if $\mathbb{T}(0,0) \neq \mathbb{T}(1,0)$ then it will lead to the breach of perfect privacy assumption.
>
> Let's suppose that $\mathbb{T}(0,0) \neq \mathbb{T}(1,0)$. That means, there must exist at least one transcript $\gamma$ that is present in $\mathbb{T}(0,0)$ but not in $\mathbb{T}(1,0)$ (or vice versa). Let $r_\gamma := (r_\textsf{Alice}^\gamma,r_\textsf{Bob}^\gamma)$ be the private randomness that was used to generate transcript $\gamma$. Since the protocol must terminate in finite number of steps, the length of $r_\gamma$ is finite. That means, a computationally unbounded adversary can enumerate all possible bit strings of length $$ \mid r_\gamma \mid $$ and run the protocol on $(a,b) := (0,0)$ and $(a,b) := (1,0)$ and find out whether $\gamma$ corresponds to $(a=0) \wedge (b=0)$ or $(a=1) \wedge (b=0).$ In other words, based on $\gamma$ alone, the adversary can find out if $a=0$ of $a=1$ with non-zero probability. This, however, is a breach of _perfect privacy assumption_ which requires that the transcripts are identically distributed.
>
> **<u>Claim</u>**: $\mathbb{T}(1,0) \cap \mathbb{T}(1,1) = \phi$
>
> **<u>Proof</u>**: This follows immediately from perfect correctness of $$2\textsf{pc}_\wedge(a;\;b)$$. If $\mathbb{T}(1,0) \cap \mathbb{T}(1,1) \neq \phi$, that means there exists a transcript $\gamma'$ such that  $\gamma' \in \mathbb{T}(1,0)$ and $\gamma' \in \mathbb{T}(1,1)$. However the output of $$2\textsf{pc}_\wedge(a;\;b)$$ is completely determined by $(a,b)$ and the transcript $\gamma'.$ (Note that the internal coin tosses of the protocol implicitly gives rise to different transcripts of the protocol, so one only needs to consider the transcript, which acts as a proxy for the internal coin tosses of the protocol). But since the output of $$2\textsf{pc}_\wedge(1;\;0) = 0$$ but $$2\textsf{pc}_\wedge(1;\;1) = 1$$ it would be a breach of perfect privacy if the same $\gamma'$ could output both $0$ and $1$ based on the internal coin tosses of the protocol. Therefore, under perfect correctness assumption $\mathbb{T}(1,0) \cap \mathbb{T}(1,1) = \phi$

Together, these results prove that one cannot have information theoretically secure oblivious transfer scheme, with perfect privacy and perfect correctness.

## Semi-honest $\textsf{OT}$ Constructions
---

### ${2 \choose 1}$ $\textsf{OT}$ from RSA Hardcore predicate

Let $n = p\cdot q$ be the product of two primes $p$ and $q$. The group of units in the Ring $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ has order $\phi(n) = (p-1)\cdot(q-1)$. Let $e$ be coprime to $\phi(n)$ and let $d := e^{-1}\mod \phi(n)$. Let $x \in \left (\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}\right)^\times$ be a unit, then the **RSA trapdoor permutation** is defined as $$f_{n,e}(x) = x^e$$ where $d$ is the trapdoor information, i.e., given $y \in \left (\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}\right)^\times$ such that $y = f_{n,e}(x)$ for some $x$, then $x = y^d \mod n$.

A result by [Alexi, Chor, Goldreich, and Schnorr](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/10.1137/0217013) states that give $n, e$ and $y \in \left (\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}\right)^\times$, where $y = x^e$ for some unknown $x$, then computing the exact value of $x$ from $y$ is at least as hard as computing the least significant bit of $x$ (i.e., $\textsf{lsb}(x)$). In other words, the least significant bit of $x$ is the hard core predicate of the RSA trapdoor permutation.

Assuming semi-honest adversary, the following scheme uses RSA hardcore predicate to build a 1-out-of-2  $\textsf{OT}$ protocol.

**Setup**:
>
> Based on security parameter $\lambda$ (say $\lambda = 2048$), the $\textsf{OT}$ sender Alice ($\mathbb{A}$), generates two random primes $p$ and $p$ of size $\lambda/2$ and computes $n = p\cdot q$, $\phi(n)$, $e$ and $d$ as described before. This one time setup can be reused for different runs of the $\textsf{OT}$ Protocol with potentially different receivers. After computing these values, $\mathbb{A}$ sends $(n,e)$ to the $\textsf{OT}$ receiver Bob ($\mathbb{B}$) and keeps $(n,e,d)$ private.
>

**Protocol Execution**:

> * $\mathbb{B} \longrightarrow \mathbb{A}$: $\left[\right.\mathbb{B}$'s choice bit is $\left. b \in \{0,1\}\right]$
>   * $\mathbb{B}$ samples two random numbers as follows
>
>     $$\begin{aligned} s &\xleftarrow{\$} \left (\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}\right)^\times \\ T &\xleftarrow{\$} \left (\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}\right)^\times \end{aligned}$$
>
>     and computes
>
>     $$S := s^e \mod n$$
>
>   * Depending upon the choice bit $b$, $\mathbb{B}$ prepares a message $\Omega$ consisting of two Ring element from $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ as follows:
>
>     $$\Omega := \begin{cases}(S,T) & \text{if } b = 0\\(T,S) & \text{if } b = 1  \end{cases}$$
>
>     and sends $\Omega$ to $\mathbb{A}$ in the left to right tuple order (i.e., sends $S$ then $T$ if $b=0$, otherwise, sends $T$ then $S$).
> * $\mathbb{A} \longrightarrow \mathbb{B}$: $\left[\right.\mathbb{A}$'s input messages are $\left. m_0, m_1 \in \{0,1\}\right]$

>
>     $$\begin{aligned} x &= X^d \mod n\\ y &= Y^d \mod n\end{aligned}$$
>
>     and extracts the hardcore bits directly as $\textsf{lsb}(x)$ and $\textsf{lsb}(y)$ and prepares the response message $\Delta$ as follows:
>
>     $$\begin{aligned}  c_0 &:= m_0 \oplus \textsf{lsb}(x)\\ c_1 &:= m_1 \oplus \textsf{lsb}(y)\\ \Delta &:= (c_0, c_1) \end{aligned}$$
>
>   * $\mathbb{A}$ then sends $\Delta$ to $\mathbb{B}$.
> * $\mathbb{B}$ Selection: Depending upon the choice bit $b$, $\mathbb{B}$ computes $m_b$ as follows:
>
>     $$m_b = c_b \oplus \textsf{lsb}(s)$$
>

**Perfect Correctness**

> When both $\mathbb{A}$ and $\mathbb{B}$ are honest, the trapdoor information $d$ allows $\mathbb{A}$ to compute the exact value of $s$ from $(X,Y)$. Given $s$, $c_b$ can be thought of one-time pad encryption of message $m_b$, which $\mathbb{B}$ can correctly decrypt.

**Perfect Privacy**

> * **$\mathbb{A}$'s privacy against computationally bounded semi-honest $\mathbb{B}$**: Since $\mathbb{B}$ is semi-honest, it follows the protocol exactly as described. In particular, it only knows the value of $s = S^d \mod n$ and not the value of $t = T^d \mod n$. (By construction, $T$ was selected randomly and $\mathbb{B}$ doesn't know $d$ that it could use to compute $t$ with significant probability). Therefore, it can only decrypt one of $c_0$ or $c_1$ with high probability.
>
>   More formally, assuming that $\textsf{lsb}(\cdot)$ hardcore predicate of the RSA function can be predicted with probability $1/2 + \epsilon$, given $c_{1-b}$ and $T$, $\mathbb{B}$ can predict the value of $m_{1-b}$ with probability $1/2 + \epsilon$.
>
> * **$\mathbb{B}$'s privacy against computationally unbounded malicious $\mathbb{A}$**: Since $S$ and $T$ are identically distributed $\mathbb{A}$ cannot predict with probability greater than $1/2$ which bit $\mathbb{B}$ is interested in. Therefore, $\mathbb{B}$'s privacy is information theoretically guaranteed. (<u>NOTE</u>: it's important that $T$ is sampled uniformly from the group of units of $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$, otherwise a computationally unbounded $\mathbb{A}$ will be able to breach $\mathbb{B}$'s privacy.)

### ${2 \choose 1}\;$ String-$\textsf{OT}$ from DDH Assumption [[Naor and Pinkas, SODA '01](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/365411.365502)]

In a String-$\textsf{OT}$ protocol, the sender has two binary strings $$m_0, m_1 \in \{0,1\}^\ell$$  (of agreed upon maximum length $\ell$) instead of two bits to send to the receiver. The receiver still has a single bit choice $b \in \{ 0, 1\}$. The sender wants to send only one of $m_0$ or $m_1$ to the receiver and the receiver wants to hide its choice bit $b$.

Let $\mathbb{G}$ be a cyclic group of order $\ell$. Let $a,b,c \xleftarrow{\$} \mathbb{Z}/\ell\mathbb{Z}$ be three arbitrary random element from the Ring $\mathbb{Z}/\ell\mathbb{Z}$. The group $\mathbb{G}$ is said to satisfy Decisional Diffie Hellman (DDH) assumption, if for all generators $g \in \mathbb{G}$ of the group, a computationally bounded adversary cannot distinguish between the distribution of $(g^a, g^b, g^{ab})$ from $(g^a, g^b, g^{c})$ with non negligible probability. (If the group is of prime order, then any generator $g$ with this property will suffice.)

Assuming semi-honest adversary, the following scheme use DDH assumption to build a $2 \choose 1$ OT scheme where the two message can be arbitrary group elements.

**Setup**:
>
> Based on the security parameter $\lambda$ the $\textsf{OT}$ sender Alice ($\mathbb{A}$) and Bob ($\mathbb{B}$) agree upon:
>    1. An appropriate cyclic group $\mathbb{G}$ of _prime_ order $\ell$ such that DDH assumption holds with $2^{-\lambda}$ distinguishing probability
>    2. A generator $g \in \mathbb{G}$

### ${n \choose 1}\, \textsf{OT}$ from ${2 \choose 1}$ String-$\textsf{OT}$ [[Naor and Pinkas](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/301250.301312), [STOC '99](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/301250.301312)]

In an ${n \choose 1}\; \textsf{OT}$ scheme, semi-honest sender Alice ($\mathbb{A}$) has $n$ messages $\{ x_0, \cdots, x_{n-1} \}$, where each $x_i$ is of length $m$ bits. Semi-honest receiver Bob ($\mathbb{B}$) has a choice index $i$ with $0 \leq i < n$. Similar to ${2 \choose 1}\;\textsf{OT}$ scheme, $\mathbb{A}$ wants to send one &mdash; and only one &mdash; of $x_j$'s to $\mathbb{B}$ but doesn't want to reveal any additional additional information about  other messages. $\mathbb{B}$, on the other hand, doesn't want $\mathbb{A}$ to learn about his choice index $i$.

The scheme by Naor and Pinkas achieves ${n \choose 1}\;\textsf{OT}$ by making $\log n$ blackbox invocations to ${2 \choose 1}\; \textsf{OT}$. The scheme also requires a PRF/PRP

$$F : \{0,1\}^\lambda \times \{0,1\}^m \mapsto \{0,1\}^m$$

where $\lambda$ is the length of the PRF-key (also assumed to be the security parameter) and $m \ge \log n$.

Define $[n] := \{0, \cdots, n-1\}$ and let $\ell = \lceil \log n \rceil$ be the number of bits needed to encode $n \in \mathbb{Z}$ as a binary string. The main idea of the paper is to generate $\ell$-pairs of $\lambda$-bit PRF keys

$$ S := \{ (s_0^0, s_0^1),  \cdots, (s_k^0, s_k^1), \cdots, (s_{\ell-1}^0, s_{\ell-1}^1) \}$$

and associate each pair $(s_k^0, s_k^1)$ with a bit position $k$ in the binary representation of $n$.

Given the list of key pairs $S$, for each index $j \in [n]$, the sender derives a new one-time-pad (OTP) encryption key based on the $\ell$-bit binary representation of $j$ as follows:
* Let the binary representation of $j$ be denoted by $\vec{j} := \{  J_0, J_1, \cdots, J_{\ell-1}\}_2$, where each $J_k \in \{0,1\}$ (without loss of generality, this document uses least significant bit first for binary representation). The encryption key $S_j$ for index $j$ consists of $\ell$-tuples

  $$S_j := (s_0^{J_0}, s_1^{J_1},\cdots,s_{\ell-1}^{J_{\ell-1}}) \in \left(\{0,1\}^\lambda\right)^\ell$$


* Define a new PRF $\widetilde{F} : \left(\{0,1\}^\lambda\right)^\ell \times \{0,1\}^m \to \{0,1\}^m$ whose key is the $\ell$-tuple $S_j$ as:

  $$\widetilde{F}(S_j, x) := \oplus_{s \in S_j} F(s, x)$$

* Given index $j \in [n]$ and message $x_j$, where $j$ is public information, the OTP encryption of any message $x \in \{0,1\}^m$ is defined as:

  $$\textsf{enc}_j(x) := x \oplus \widetilde{F}(S_j, j)$$

Based on the above encryption scheme, a semi-honest sender $\mathbb{A}$ first enumerates all possible $2^\ell$ tuple of keys $S_j$ and then, for each $j \in [n] \subset [2^\ell]$, encrypts $x_j$ using $\textsf{enc}_j(x_j)$ to obtain $n$ ciphertexts:

$$C_j := x_j\oplus \widetilde{F}(S_j,j) = x_j\oplus_{s \in S_j} {F}(s,j)$$

Since $S_j \neq S_k$ whenever $j \neq k$, invocations of the PRF $\widetilde{F}$ for distinct indices $j$ and $k$ differ by at least one key $s_{\alpha}^\beta$ for some $\alpha, \beta$. In other words, a semi-honest sender will never encrypt two messages $x_j$ an $x_k$ with the same key unless $j = k$.

**<u>NOTE</u>**: When evaluating $F(\cdot, j)$, the value of $j$ as an argument to $F$ should be encoded as $m$-bit binary string.

Let $i \in [n]$ be receiver's choice index. Let the bit decomposition of $i$ be denoted by $$\vec{i} := \{I_0, I_1,  \cdots, I_{\ell -1}\}_2$$. In order to decrypt $C_i$, the receiver needs access to the $\ell$-tuple of keys $S_i := (s_{0}^{I_{0}}, s_1^{I_1},  \cdots, s_{\ell-1}^{I_{\ell - 1}})$, which $\mathbb{B}$ can get by performing $\ell$ parallel executions of ${2 \choose 1}$ string-$\textsf{OT}$ by invoking

$$\begin{aligned} s_{0}^{I_{0}} &\leftarrow \textsf{OT}(s_0^0, s_0^1;\; I_{0}) \\ s_{1}^{I_{1}} &\leftarrow \textsf{OT}(s_1^0, s_1^1;\; I_{1}) \\ & \quad \vdots \\ s_{\ell-1}^{I_{\ell-1}} &\leftarrow \textsf{OT}(s_{\ell-1}^0, s_{\ell-1}^1;\; I_{\ell-1}) \end{aligned}$$

Once $\mathbb{B}$ has access to $S_i$, it can decrypt $x_i$ as follows:

$$x_i = C_i \oplus \widetilde{F}(S_i, i) = C_i\oplus_{k=0}^{\ell - 1} F(s_k^{I_k}, i)$$


Notice that the ${2 \choose 1}$ string-$\textsf{OT}$ hides each and every bit $\{ I_k \}_{k \in [\ell]}$ of $i$ from a semi-honest sender $\mathbb{A}$. Therefore, the index $i$ is itself hidden from $\mathbb{A}$ after $\ell$ parallel executions. Furthermore, for every key $s_k^{I_k}$ the ${2 \choose 1}$ string-$\textsf{OT}$ hides information about $s_k^{(1 - I_k)}$ (here, $(1 - I_k)$ should be treated as superscript computation), and the only message that the receiver can decrypt correctly is at index $i$. Therefore, all other messages apart from $x_i$ remain hidden from semi-honest $\mathbb{B}.$

For the security proof to work, it's important that $\mathbb{B}$ performs $\ell$ parallel ${2 \choose 1}\;\textsf{OT}$ invocations _before_ the sender sends $\{ C_k \}_{k \in [n]}$. A formal (and very enlightening) proof of security can be found in the original paper.

> Suppose the receiver $\mathbb{B}$ is interested in index $i=2$. The bit decomposition of $i$ is $\vec{2} = (0, 1)_2$ (this is LSB-first bit decomposition). The receiver should then do two oblivious transfers: One for bit position zero, with sender messages  $(s_0^0, s_1^0)$ and another one for bit position one, with sender messages  $(s_0^1, s_1^1)$. The receiver's choice bits for the first $\textsf{OT}$ is $0$ (since bit zero of $2$ has value $0$) and the receiver choice bits for the second $\textsf{OT}$ is $1$ (bit one of $2$ has value $1$). At the end of $\textsf{OT}$ invocations, receiver $\mathbb{B}$ will have access to $s_0^0$ and $s_1^1$, based on which it can compute:

Similarly the transfer of $s_1^1$ from messages $(s_1^0, s_1^1)$ completely hides information about $s_0^1$. Furthermore, for all $j \neq k$, $S_k \setminus S_j \neq \phi$, therefore $$\mathbf{Pr}\left[\widetilde{F}(S_k,\cdot) = \widetilde{F}(S_j,\cdot)\; \mid \; j \neq k \right] < \frac{1}{2^{m-1}} \leq \frac{1}{2^\lambda}$$ which ensures that the receiver cannot decrypt any message index other than $i$. This guarantees sender's privacy.
>   * The receiver's privacy guarantees afforded by ${2\choose 1} \textsf{OT}$ ensures that the bits of $i$ (i.e., $\{I_k\}_{k \in [ell]}$) remain hidden from the sender during individual $\textsf{OT}$ invocations. This guarantees receiver's privacy.
