My name is Yogesh Swami. I'm primarily interested in Cryptographic
Protocol Design, with a strong bias towards provable (reductionist)
security. I have a broad-based knowledge of Complexity Theoretic
aspects of Number Theory, Abstract Algebra, Elliptic Curves, and
Lattice based cryptography. In the past, I have designed and
implemented several Cryptographic Protocols in Hardware Security
Module (HSM) as well as host software, and I'm always curious to
analyze and break real world system.
