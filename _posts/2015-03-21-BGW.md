In preparation for "proving" that Oblivious Transfer (OT) purely from a
symmetric-key black box is unlikely, this brief post describes the
information theoretically secure MPC protocol of Ben-Or, Goldwasser, and
Wigderson [^BGW88]. The actual content is based on Asharov and Lindell
[^AL11], who updated their 2011 paper just yesterday (this post,
however, is based on the 2011 version of their paper).
