My name is [Yogesh Swami][linkedin]. I'm
primarily interested in Cryptographic Protocol Design and
Implementation, with a strong bias towards provable security. I'm also
interested in provably correct (i.e., formally verified)
implementation of Cryptographic Protocols. Occasionally, I also get
too excited about Complexity Theory, Commutative Algebra/Algebraic
Geometry, Formal logic/Proof Theory and (dependently typed) Functional
Programming Languages (mainly [Haskell][Haskell], but also
[Idris][Idris] and sometimes [Agda][Agda] and [CoQ][CoQ]).
