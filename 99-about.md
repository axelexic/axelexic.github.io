My name is Yogesh Swami. I'm primarily interested in Cryptographic
Protocol Design, with a strong bias towards provable (reductionist)
security. In my free time, I also spend considerable time on
Computational Number Theory, Abstract Algebra, Proof Theory and
functional programming languages (mainly Haskell and Idris).
